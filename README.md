# 8 Bit Arcade Game
This is the third project from the **Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree** by **Udacity**. It's an arcade game made with **JavaScript**, which I rebranded as **"8 Bit Arcade Game"**, in which the user needs to move a character across the field without colliding with enemy bugs.

## Instructions
* To play the game, [access this link](https://txago.github.io/8bit-arcade-game/)
* Click on the **Let's Start** button to begin a new game
* Use your keyboard arrows to go through the field up until the water
* Be careful and avoid colliding with the bugs!
